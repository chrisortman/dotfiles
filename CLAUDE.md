This is my dotfiles repo. I use it to keep my configuration for both an ubuntu development
system and a macOS development system.

I do not worry too much about making sure that the configuration is the same or using the
exact same files between the two different operating systems. But I do want it to be
fairly easy to move the changes from one to the other.

The ubuntu-noble branch tracks what I use on ubuntu, and the macOS branch tracks what
I use on macOS.
